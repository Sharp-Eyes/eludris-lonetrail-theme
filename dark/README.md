# Eludris Lonetrail Theme - Dark Mode

## What the heck is a Lonetrail?

[Lone Trail](https://arknights.wiki.gg/wiki/Lone_Trail), stylized as Lonetrail, is the thirty-first major event, fifth Intermezzo, and the fifth Celebration event in [Arknights](https://www.arknights.global/). 

This theme is based around the in-game UI elements for this event, which loosely follow minimalistic 1950s~1970s design styles.
As a mild disclaimer, this dark theme strays further away from how the in-game UI looks.
The main colours were extracted from the single release [I Will Touch the Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMio0Q1XpH0).

## See something weird?

Let me know in an issue on the [repository](https://github.com/sharp-eyes/eludris-lonetrail-theme) or in the [Eludris discord server](https://discord.gg/vV6v2DhWQB), and I'll try to get it sorted.
